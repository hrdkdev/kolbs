# Kolb's Learning Cycle: Quick Guide

## The Core Idea

Transform experiences into growth through 4 stages:
1. **Experience** - What happened (facts only, 1-5 sentences)
2. **Reflection** - How you felt, patterns you noticed
3. **Abstraction** - The general principle ("I tend to X when Y")
4. **Experiment** - One specific action to try

**The magic:** Try experiment → Observe results → Reflect on results → Create new experiment. This loop creates continuous improvement.

## The Four Stages (Keep It Simple)

### 1. Experience
- **What happened:** 1-5 sentences, just facts
- Good: "Sarah questioned my timeline. I got defensive. Room went quiet."
- Bad: "I presented and it was terrible and I always do this..."
- Add: domain (work/study/health), tags (defensive, focus, etc.)

### 2. Reflection
- **What you felt and noticed:** Answer 2-3 prompts or write bullets
- Good: "Felt defensive before I even heard her full question. Pattern: I defend when uncertain."
- Bad: "I felt bad."
- Use app's 9 prompts if stuck

### 3. Abstraction
- **The pattern:** "I tend to X when Y happens"
- Good: "I tie self-worth to competence, so questions feel like attacks. Happens at work and home."
- Bad: Retelling the story or "I should be better"

### 4. Experiment
- **One specific action:** Observable behavior with a trigger
- Good: "When questioned, pause 3 seconds, say 'good question', then respond"
- Bad: "Try to be less defensive"
- Set review date to check results

## When to Mark Complete

Mark complete when all 4 stages are filled + you have 1 experiment (or checked "no experiment needed").

**Good enough = 30 minutes max:**
- One clear pattern identified
- One specific experiment
- Don't overthink it

## Closing the Loop (MOST IMPORTANT)

**The real learning happens here:**

1. Try your experiment for 1-2 weeks
2. When done, go to Experiments tab → Edit → Add outcome notes → Click "Reflect"
3. Create new entry about the experiment results
4. This creates the improvement spiral

**Example:**
- Entry 1: "I get defensive" → Experiment: "Pause 3 seconds before responding"
- (Try it for 2 weeks)
- Entry 2: "Pause worked in 4/5 situations, still hard when tired" → Experiment: "Add energy tracking"
- (Repeat)

Keep 1-3 active experiments max. Actually do them.

## Simple Workflow

**Weekly (30 minutes):**
1. Create 1 entry about the most important thing that happened
2. Complete all 4 stages (use 30-minute timer)
3. Review active experiments: update status or mark abandoned
4. Check "review due" filter - reflect on any completed experiments

**Monthly:**
- Use tag filter to find patterns (if "defensive" shows up 10 times, that's a pattern)
- Are experiments actually changing behavior? If not, make them more specific

## Don't Do These

❌ Stage 1 more than 5 sentences
❌ Stage 3 is retelling the story (that's Stage 1)
❌ Vague experiments ("try harder", "be better")
❌ 10+ active experiments
❌ Never clicking "Reflect" on completed experiments
❌ Spending 2+ hours per entry

## You're Doing It Right When

✅ Trying experiments in real life
✅ Creating new entries when experiments complete
✅ Behavior actually changing
✅ 1-3 active experiments
✅ 30 minutes per entry max
✅ Experiments are specific ("pause 3 seconds" not "be calmer")
